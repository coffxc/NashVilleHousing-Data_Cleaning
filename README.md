## What is Data Cleaning?

Data cleaning is an integral part in Data analysis.
Data cleaning in SQL typically involves identifying and correcting errors or inconsistencies in a database to ensure that the data is accurate, complete, and reliable.

## Things to Do

In this project, various inconsistencies were identified in the data, including improper formatting and numerous duplicate values. To address these issues, a range of techniques was employed, starting from basic concepts such as updating the table and using the CAST function, to more advanced concepts like joins, common table expressions (CTEs), window functions, and more. These approaches significantly enhanced my knowledge of data cleaning and helped in removing inconsistencies from the dataset.
